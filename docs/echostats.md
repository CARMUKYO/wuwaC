## 3. Implementation Instructions for Antigravity
1. **Dropdown Selection:** When a user selects a Substat type, the slider should "snap" only to the 8 (or 4) discrete values listed above.
2. **Main Stat Scaling:** Main stat sliders should be bounded by the (Min - Max) values corresponding to the selected Echo Cost.
3. **Validation:** Ensure the Primary Main Stat, Secondary Main Stat, and any Substat of the same type (e.g., ATK%) are treated as separate additions to the total character sheet.
